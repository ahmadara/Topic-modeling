# Topic-modeling
In this project, tweets are gathered by utilizing the Twitter API. The acquired tweets undergo text preprocessing and cleaning. Ultimately, the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) technique is employed to conduct topic mode


The purpose of this project is to analyze public sentiment during natural disasters to enable faster assistance. To achieve this, the focus was on the floods that occurred in 2021. Tweets related to this event were collected from users.

The collected tweets underwent data cleaning and preprocessing. Since the data was in the German (Almalani) language, it was translated using the Google Translate library.

In the next step, text processing was performed on the data to prepare it for the subsequent stages. The bigram and trigram techniques were utilized to consider multi-word phrases instead of single words as the evaluation metric.

Finally, the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) method was used for topic modeling.
